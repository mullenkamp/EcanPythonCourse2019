Prerequisites
=================================================

Using the Jupyter Notebooks for the courses modules
---------------------------------------------------
This courses uses self contained code sets called `Jupyter Notebooks <http://jupyter.org/>`_. The courses will not explicitly require you to install python on your PC, but you are welcome to try as described in the next paragraph. Consequently for the courses, the preferred method to run the notebooks will be through the `binder <https://mybinder.org/>`_ links that build the correct python environment for the notebooks to be run under. This ensures that no one will have issues properly running the notebooks.

**Please run through** the short notebook `A quick tour of Jupyter/IPython Notebooks <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Data-to-Knowledge/Hydrosoc-python-2018.git/master?filepath=jupyter%2Fpandas-cookbook%2Fcookbook%2FA%20quick%20tour%20of%20IPython%20Notebook.ipynb>`_. It will familiarise you with Jupyter notebooks and some of its capabilities, but don't worry if you don't understand everything.
